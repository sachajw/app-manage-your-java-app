# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
gemini command:

 ### Examples:

**Single file analysis:**
 ```bash
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"

Multiple files:
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"

Entire directory:
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"

Multiple directories:
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"

Current directory and subdirectories:
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"

#
Or use --all_files flag:
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"

Implementation Verification Examples

Check if a feature is implemented:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"

Verify authentication implementation:
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"

Check for specific patterns:
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"

Verify error handling:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"

Check for rate limiting:
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"

Verify caching strategy:
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"

Check for specific security measures:
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"

Verify test coverage for features:
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"
```

When to Use Gemini CLI

Use gemini -p when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results # Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

## Overview

This is a Java web application tutorial project for the Humanitec Platform Orchestrator and Score. It demonstrates managing a Java application with containerization and platform deployment tools.

## Architecture

- **Java Web Application**: Maven-based Jakarta Servlet application
- **Single Servlet**: `DemoServlet.java` at `/hello` endpoint that accepts `greets` parameter
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker build with Maven compilation and Tomcat deployment
- **Platform Deployment**: Uses Score specification for service definition and Humanitec for orchestration

## Key Commands

### Build & Development
```bash
# Build Docker image
make build

# Push Docker image to registry
make push

# Direct Maven build (inside container)
mvn clean install
```

### Docker Operations
```bash
# Build image with default tag
docker build -t ghcr.io/humanitec-tutorials/manage-your-java-app:latest .

# Build and push (used in CI)
docker build -t ghcr.io/humanitec-tutorials/manage-your-java-app:latest --push .
```

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/humanitec/tutorials/DemoServlet.java` - Main servlet implementation
- `pom.xml` - Maven configuration for Jakarta Servlet webapp
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build: Maven compilation â†’ Tomcat deployment
- `score.yaml` - Score specification defining service ports and container
- `Makefile` - Build and push targets
- `.env` - Humanitec platform configuration and image registry settings

## Configuration

The application uses:
- **Java 8** target compilation
- **Jakarta Servlet API 6.0.0** (provided scope)
- **Tomcat** as the runtime servlet container
- **Port 8080** for both service exposure and Tomcat default

## Deployment

The application is designed for deployment via:
- Score specification defining service structure
- Humanitec Platform Orchestrator for environment management
- Container registry at `docker.io/thevestedleopard/manage-your-java-app`
